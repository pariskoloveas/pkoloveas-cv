\color{gray}{Summary}
& I am a Data Science Researcher, mainly focused on Natural Language Processing \& Understanding tasks. 
As a PhD candidate in Scientometrics, my research focuses on the analysis of scientific publications using NLP and Deep Learning techniques. 
I am particularly interested in Citation Intent Classification, which involves identifying the purpose of citations in publications to provide insights into their impact. Previously, my focus has been around applications of NLP in the Cyber-Security domain, specifically, text mining, information filtering and knowledge extraction for Cyber-Threat Intelligence discovery. \\
