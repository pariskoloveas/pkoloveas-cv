\color{gray}{Summary}
& I am a Data Science Researcher, mainly focused on Natural Language Processing \& Understanding tasks. 
As a PhD candidate in Scientometrics, my research focuses on analyzing scientific publications using NLP and Deep Learning techniques. Specifically, I am interested in the Citation Intent Classification task, which involves identifying the purpose of citations in scientific publications to provide insights into their impact. Previously, my focus has been around applications of NLP in the Cyber-Security domain, specifically, text mining, information filtering and knowledge extraction for Cyber-Threat Intelligence discovery. \\
